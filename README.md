### Description:

{Project Name} is a mobile-friendly web application designed to make discovering new restraument menu items as simple as tapping a few buttons on your phone.

    -   Styled-Components
    -   React-Router

    -   Express
        -   Passport.js

    -   Focused primarily on writing the application core, including the coupling of a server running Node.js and a client running React, as well as providing a flexible GraphQL API for public use.
-   **Fiore Cheyenne**
    -   Focused primarily on the front-end user interactions and design using React and Styled-Components, as well as the front-end routing using React-Router.
-   **Juan Palomino**
    -   Focused primarily on providing user API routes, user authentication using Passport.js, as well as user password security via hash encryption using Bcrypt.

### About:

We started with the idea to make a menu randomizer to make discovering new food and drinks as simple and easy as possible. From there, we choose to use the Agile Methology of Kanban for continous development.

We started with defining the structure of our data, wireframing our initial user interface and site flow, and deciding on our application MVP. From our MVP, we broke down the core components of our application, and each choose one thing to start working on.
